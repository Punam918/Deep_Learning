This directory contains a collection of Python scripts showcasing various deep learning concepts and applications. It includes implementations for building and training neural networks (ANNs and CNNs) on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion MNIST, as well as experiments with object detection using the COCO dataset. Key topics covered include gradient descent, regularization techniques, hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16, word embeddings for NLP, and image augmentation. Additionally, the projects explore foundational concepts such as the differences between ANNs and CNNs, optimization strategies, and advanced model configurations. These scripts provide a hands-on approach to understanding and applying deep learning techniques effectively.
